# Ditoo measurement bench

A measurement-first harness for the Divoom Ditoo: figure out what the four
channels (display, audio, mic, buttons) can actually do, with real numbers,
before we build any creative layer on top.

```
bench/
  probe.py           static detection — no Bluetooth permission needed
  display_bench.py   per-frame latency, FPS, ACK errors over 100+ pushes
  audio_bench.py     `say` and `afplay` startup latency
  buttons_listen.py  capture inbound RFCOMM packets when you press buttons
  results/           CSV / JSONL / markdown logs from runs
```

## How to use this

### 0. Pair the Light half of the Ditoo

`probe.py` only sees the **Audio** half on your machine right now. The
**Light** half is a separate Bluetooth device that drives the pixel display.
Hold the Ditoo's power button to put it in pairing mode and connect
`Divoom Ditoo-*-Light` from System Settings → Bluetooth.

### 1. Run `probe.py`

```bash
python3 bench/probe.py
```

This needs no Bluetooth permission. It tells you:

- Is the Swift bridge present and signed?
- Which Divoom devices are paired (Audio / Light)?
- Is the Ditoo currently the system audio output?
- Which TTS voices are installed?

If the verdict says you're ready, it prints the exact command for the next step.

### 2. Run `display_bench.py` with your Light MAC

```bash
python3 bench/display_bench.py --mac <LIGHT_MAC>
```

**First run will pop a macOS dialog: "Terminal wants to use Bluetooth". Click Allow.**

Pushes 5 × 40 = 200 frames over RFCOMM at five different palette sizes (solid,
4-color, 16-color, 64-color, 256-color noise) and reports per-frame latency
percentiles plus sustained FPS. Writes a per-frame CSV under `results/`.

**What numbers tell you what:**

- p50 < 100 ms — display will feel snappy; arbitrary animation works.
- p50 100–250 ms — fine for state changes; full-frame loops at 4 fps or less.
- p50 > 250 ms — something is wrong (BT interference, wrong channel, bad pair).

The "noise" profile produces the largest packets (max palette = 256 colors) so
it's the slowest. If even "solid" is slow, the BT connection itself is the bottleneck.

### 3. Run `audio_bench.py`

```bash
python3 bench/audio_bench.py
```

Measures `say` and `afplay` wall time over N trials. Reports mean / p50 / p95 / σ.

**Important: this measures whatever audio device is *currently* the system default.**
To measure the Ditoo specifically, set System Settings → Sound → Output to the
Divoom Ditoo first, then run.

**What numbers tell you what:**

- `afplay` < 300 ms for a short clip — speakers wake fast; chimes feel instant.
- `afplay` 300–1000 ms — typical for Bluetooth speakers waking from sleep.
- `say` < 800 ms — pet voice will feel responsive.
- `say` > 1500 ms — pre-render phrases to WAVs and `afplay` them instead.

### 4. Run `buttons_listen.py` to reverse-engineer the input

```bash
# Free mode: poke around for 60 seconds, watch packets
python3 bench/buttons_listen.py --mac <LIGHT_MAC>

# Guided mode: I walk you through each button
python3 bench/buttons_listen.py --mac <LIGHT_MAC> --guided
```

The Ditoo's keyboard / play buttons *might* send inbound RFCOMM packets that we
can use as triggers. **No one in the open-source reverse-engineering community
has documented this** — that's why we measure rather than assume. The script
captures everything that comes in on the channel and tells you whether any
button press produced bytes.

Three outcomes:

1. **Bytes flow when you press buttons** — we win. Output: a signature map
   you can wire to Claude Code actions.
2. **No bytes** — try `--channel 2`, then conclude buttons aren't on this channel.
3. **Bytes flow but they're meaningless** — they exist but are heartbeats or
   power notifications. The signature map will make this obvious.

### What's deliberately not here

- **Mic capture.** The Ditoo's mic uses Bluetooth HFP, which kicks the speaker
  into 8 kHz call quality. That's a creative-direction tradeoff (do we want a
  pet that listens? at the cost of music quality?), not a measurement question.
  We'll address it in the "fun stuff" phase.

## Cleanup

Every run writes to `bench/results/` with a timestamp. Safe to delete the
directory at any time — nothing else reads from it.
