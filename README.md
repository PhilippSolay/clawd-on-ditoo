# 🦀 Clawd on Ditoo

**A tiny orange crab who lives on your Divoom Ditoo Pro, judges your code, and naps when you walk away.**

*He blinks. He thinks when Claude thinks. He throws a gear when you call a tool, a heart when you ship, and a tiny existential crisis when you don't. Clap once to poke him. Clap twice to put him to bed. He speaks fluent chiptune.*

### 🖥️ [Get the Mac app →](clawd_app/)

## Wait, what is this

Clawd is a pixel pet for the **Divoom Ditoo Pro** (that little 16×16 retro speaker-with-a-screen). He reacts to your [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) sessions in real time — idle, thinking, tool-use, celebration, panic, sleep — and chirps about it out of the Ditoo's own speaker while your music keeps playing wherever you like. He is, frankly, the most emotionally available coworker you'll have.

> 📊 Built measurement-first, because we have *standards*. The real latency/throughput numbers are in **[FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md)**.

## The catch (it's a fun one)

The Ditoo line is **Bluetooth-only** — no Wi-Fi — so every "just use the Pixoo HTTP API" tutorial on the internet is, for our purposes, a beautiful lie. And despite what the write-ups claim, the Ditoo **Pro shows up as a single Bluetooth device** (`DitooPro-Audio`). There is no separate `-Light` device. That was a red herring and we fell for it so you don't have to. Pixel control rides a serial channel **on that same device — RFCOMM channel 2.**

```

 Divoom Ditoo Pro — pixels           Divoom Ditoo Pro — speaker            │  audio full-quality)
```

Three tiny Swift helpers because each macOS audio/Bluetooth API is native-only and refuses to be reasoned with. Everything else is Python, so the crab stays hackable.

## The easy way: just give me the crab 🦀

Build the **[menu-bar app](clawd_app/)** once and never touch a terminal again:

```bash
./clawd_app/build.sh        # produces clawd_app/Clawd.app
open clawd_app/Clawd.app     # a little crab appears in your menu bar
```

First launch, the app will ask for **Bluetooth** and **Microphone** — say yes, that's how he sees the Ditoo and hears your claps. Then from the menu bar:

1. **Settings…** → pop in your Ditoo's MAC (find it with `./bench/discover.sh`), tweak anything you like.
2. **Start Clawd** → he hatches with a wake chirp.
3. **✓ Launch at Login** → and now he just *exists*, forever, like a good crab.

> 🔐 Why a menu-bar app and not a daemon you `sudo` into oblivion? macOS pins Bluetooth/Mic permission to whatever *launches* the thing. The app owns the daemon, so you grant permission **once** and it sticks. You're welcome.

## The terminal way (for the brave / the headless)

```bash
# 1. Find your Ditoo's MAC + confirm the pixel channel is RFCOMM 2
./bench/discover.sh

# 2. Bring him to life (he hatches with a chirp + "Hi! I'm Clawd")
./bin/clawd start --foreground --mac AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -v

# 3. Wire him into your coding (reacts to your real Claude Code sessions)
./bin/clawd install-hooks
```

Replace `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` with *your* MAC. We're not putting ours on the internet again. 🙃

## How to play

- 👏 **clap once** → poke him (startle + heart + bip)
- 👏👏 **clap twice fast** → tuck him in / wake him up
- 🚶 **wander off ~4 min** → he yawns and naps

## Settings: he's high-maintenance (lovingly)

Every knob lives in `~/.clawd/config.json` — **sounds, voice, mic, animations, sleep**. The daemon applies most changes **live** (no restart): volume, brightness, nap timer, fidget frequency, clap sensitivity, the works.

Change them three ways: the **Settings window** in the menu-bar app, by hand, or via CLI:

```bash
clawd config                                    # show everything
clawd config set animations.brightness 40       # dim the mood lighting
clawd config set voice.babble false             # tell him to stop muttering
clawd config set sleep.idle_to_sleep_seconds 600  # night owl mode
```

A few settings (`device.mac`, `device.channel`, `sounds.audio_device`) need a restart — the CLI will tell you which.

## Make him yours

- **Sprites** — `divoom_pet/sprites/clawd.py` (16-row strings, one char per pixel). Regenerate the gallery: `python3 -m divoom_pet.sprites.clawd previews/`.
- **Voice** — `divoom_pet/voice/sounds.py`: `CHIRPS` (chiptune melodies, multiple random variants each), `SPOKEN` (TTS one-liners), and an animalese-style babble so he can mutter to himself. Audition: `clawd sounds preview`.
- **Vibes** — `AUTO_TIMEOUTS` / idle behavior in `divoom_pet/daemon/state_machine.py` and the idle fidget weights in `clawd.py`.

## The full CLI

```
clawd start [--mac MAC] [--simulate] [--no-sound] [--no-ears] [--foreground] [-v]
clawd stop
clawd state [--set STATE]              poke the state machine directly
clawd poke / chirp / demo              mess with him
clawd notify progress|badge|banner     push live content (see below)
clawd notify play|effect <name>        play a drop-in asset / procedural effect
clawd say "text"                       speak arbitrary text (live voice)
clawd assets [build|list]              turn assets/*.png|gif into animations
clawd watch [--repo R] [--interval S]  react to GitHub PRs / CI (needs gh)
clawd sounds [preview|render]          audition / rebuild the voice
clawd config [show | set K V]          read / change settings
clawd doctor                           "is the crab okay??"
clawd install-hooks                    wire into Claude Code
```

States: `idle thinking typing tool_use happy alert sleeping hatch poke`.

## Live content: Clawd shows you what's happening 📊

On top of his moods, Clawd can overlay **data** — a progress bar, a counter, a
big-moment banner — flattened onto the same 16×16 by a little compositor. Anything
can drive it through one generic surface (`POST /event` / the `clawd notify` CLI),
so it's not just Claude Code:

```bash
clawd notify progress 0.6              # a bar fills under him (0..1)
clawd notify badge 3 --color amber     # a count in the corner
clawd notify banner "MERGED" --mood happy --speak done   # a scrolling takeover
clawd notify progress --clear          # take the bar away
```

Wired into Claude Code (via `install-hooks`) he does this automatically:

- **TodoWrite → a real progress bar** (completed / total todos).
- **Subagent finishes → an "agents home" tally badge** + a delighted poke;
  `SessionStart` zeroes it.
- **`clawd watch`** polls a repo with `gh`: a **new PR**, **CI red/green**, or a
  **merge** triggers a banner (+ mood + voice). Run it inside your repo, or point
  it anywhere with `--repo owner/name`.

### Animations: procedural *and* drop-in

Two ways to give Clawd new moves:

```bash
clawd notify effect confetti     # procedural, "live-created" from math, no art files:
                                 #   confetti fireworks plasma pulse
                                 #   starfield matrix spinner rainbow
clawd notify clock               # show the time (HH stacked over MM)

cp my_cute_loop.gif assets/      # drop-in: any PNG/GIF
clawd assets build               # → downscaled to 16×16, palette-snapped, named
clawd notify play my_cute_loop   # → Clawd plays it
```

Built assets are cached as plain JSON in `~/.clawd/assets/` (so the daemon loads
them with stdlib only — Pillow is needed just at `build` time, like the sounds).

### Live voice

Beyond his canned chirps, Clawd can speak *anything*:

```bash
clawd say "Pull request merged!"
clawd notify banner "MERGED" --mood happy --say "Pull request merged!"
```

A **warm vocabulary** of common announcements (PR merged, CI status, "N agents
done"…) is pre-rendered shortly after startup, so those speak instantly (~650 ms).
Anything novel renders once via `say` (~1.7 s) and is cached, so it's warm next
time. `clawd watch` uses these phrases, so a merge actually *says* "Pull request
merged!" while the banner scrolls.

### Hands-free

Let Clawd run himself — git-hook recipes (react to commits/merges), an always-on
launchd PR watcher, and a test-result wrapper all live in [`examples/`](examples/).
Copy, tweak the paths, done.
